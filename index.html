            <h2>What is Cybersecurity?</h2>
            <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users through ransomware; or interrupting normal business processes.

                Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative.
                
                A successful cybersecurity posture has multiple layers of protection spread across the computers, networks, programs, or data that one intends to keep safe. In an organization, a unified threat management gateway system can automate integrations across products and accelerate key security operations functions: detection, investigation, and remediation. People, processes, and technology must all complement one another to create an effective defense from cyberattacks.</p>
            <h3>Why is Cybersecurity Important?</h3>
            <p>As more data is stored online, cybersecurity is vital for protecting personal and organizational information. With rising threats like hacking and ransomware, strong security measures are essential to ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. These protections prevent unauthorized access, maintain system reliability, and build trust. Effective cybersecurity also ensures regulatory compliance and protects the reputation of organizations in a vulnerable digital world.</p>
